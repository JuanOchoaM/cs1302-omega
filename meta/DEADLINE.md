## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

Snake Game! Traditional style arcade game that challenges you to fill the
whole screen! Move the snake in order to eat the green apples around the map
with UP arrow, DOWN arrow, RIGHT arrow, and LEFT arrow.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned that there is a massive selection of methods and classes, all interlinking
with each other in a beautiful way. Creating this snake game was a fun project to
do for the final.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would start brainstorming with different functions from the start.
It was not until later that I realized the difficulty of creating methods
from scratch.
